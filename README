1. We see a difference in webpage fetch times with short and large router buffers due to buferbloat happening here. 
This can be seen as in q100 the mean delay is almost 3 times that in q20. In TCP we use a sliding window mechanism where 
the number of unacknowledged packets that can be in-flight is equal to its window size. In the case of a large buffer size, the 
TCP keeps increasing its window size until the buffer is filled. Due to this TCP is unaware of the dropped packets and it 
keeps sending at high rates. Also since the buffer size is large, it takes more time to empty it. In contrast, for small
buffer sizes, the TCP congestion avoidance is achieved more quickly due to the small buffer size so TCP keeps sending packets
at a more manageable rate.

2. txqueuelen=1000 and MTU=1500.
Latency = (1000 packets x 1500 bytes x 8 bits)/(100Mbps) = 0.12s 
The maximum time a packet might wait in the queue is 0.12s at worst

3. RTT reported by ping increases as queue size increases. This is because more packets are present in the queue, causing the 
packets to have a longer queue delay. A longer queue delay (due to a larger queue size) leads to a longer RTT because the packet spends 
more time waiting in the queue before being transmitted.
In general,
RTT = Propagation Delay + Queue Delay + Transmission Delay, thus RTT is directly proportional to Queue Delay assuming Propagation and Transmission Delay
to be constant

4. Two ways to mitigate the bufferbloat problem:
i) Reduce the queue size. This can be clearly seen as in q20 we get better response time than q100.
ii) We can use Random Early Detection (RED). It monitors the length of the queue and selectively drops or marks packets before the queue becomes completely full. 
This signals to the sender that congestion is starting to occur, prompting it to reduce its sending rate.
