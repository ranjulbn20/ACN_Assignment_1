1. We see a difference in webpage fetch times with short and large router buffers due to buferbloat happening here. 
This can be seen as in q100 the mean delay is almost 3 times that in q20. In TCP we use a sliding window mechanism where 
the number of unacknowledged packets that can be in-flight is equal to its window size. In case of large buffer size, the 
TCP keeps increasing its window size until the buffer is filled. Due to this TCP is unaware of the dropped packets and it 
keeps sending at high rates. Also since the buffer size is large, it takes more time to empty it. In contrast, for small
buffer size, the TCP congestion avoidance is achieved more quickly due to small buffer size so TCP keeps sending packets
at a more manageable rate.

2. txqueuelen=1000 and MTU=1500.
Latency = (1000 packets x 1500 bytes x 8 bits)/(100Mbps) = 0.12s 
The maximum time a packet might wait in the queue is 0.12s at worst
